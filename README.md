Trello Badger (WIP)
===================

Trello [Power-Ups][] provide great capabilities to build new things.

While sometimes you only want to hack a little part of the tool.

You can use a customizable browser extension to try things out.

This is such an add-on, tagret on "badge" usage:

- Subtotal

  Count badge usage, assume badge text is number, then show total on each list. 


## Status

Under development.


## Build

    web-ext build --artifacts-dir= --ignore-files *.md *.zsh
